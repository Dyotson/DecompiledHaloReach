# Halo Reach PC — native static recompilation of the Xbox 360 build

Goal: run Halo: Reach (Xbox 360, Title ID `4D53085B`, base version 1.0 / no TU,
Media ID `566C10D3`) natively on x86-64 Linux (and later Windows) by statically
recompiling `default.xex` (PowerPC Xenon) to C++ with the ReXGlue SDK, then add:

- the original Credits (cR) / rank / Armory progression (no microtransactions),
- peer-to-peer online play (replacing Xbox Live / system link),
- Forge plus file share (upload/download maps, gametypes, mods).

## Layout (all paths relative to `/home/dyotson/Documents/Halo Reach PC`)

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `Halo - Reach (...).iso` | Original disc image. READ ONLY. Never modify or delete. |
| `extracted/xbox360/` | Game partition extracted from the ISO (`default.xex`, `maps/*.map`, ...). Treat as read only. |
| `tools/xdvdfs_extract.py` | Read-only XDVDFS extractor. |
| `tools/start_ghidra_headless_mcp.sh` | Starts the headless GhidraMCP server (already running in tmux session `ghidra-headless`). |
| `ghidra_projects/HaloReach` | Ghidra project: `/xbox360/default.xex` (PPC BE 64, 32-bit addr) and `/mcc/haloreach.dll` (MCC PC build of Reach, x86-64). Both auto-analyzed. |
| `reach-recomp/` | ReXGlue project. `reach_manifest.toml` drives codegen; `generated/` is codegen output (do not hand-edit); `src/` is our runtime code. |
| `docs/` | Design docs and findings. |

MCC install (READ ONLY): `/home/dyotson/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Halo The Master Chief Collection/haloreach/`.

## Tooling

- ReXGlue SDK: build against the **0.10.0.24 nightly** at `~/rexglue-sdk-nightly/0.10.0.24/linux-amd64`
  (fixes `stwcx.` atomics, sync fences and VMX pack aliasing; regenerate with its `bin/rexglue`).
  Build dir `reach-recomp/out/build/linux-nightly`. v0.10.0 is still at `~/rexglue-sdk/linux-amd64`
  (do not build `linux-release` any more: its codegen step would overwrite `generated/` with 0.10.0 output). (`bin/rexglue`, CMake package under `lib/cmake/rexglue`). Docs: https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk/wiki
- **Patched GPU plugin (required):** the SDK's Vulkan shader translator scales every texture
  sample by 2^(bits of the LOD bias) (rexglue-sdk#456, closed upstream as "not accepting Xenos GPU
  edits"). `tools/build_rexglue_sdk.sh` builds `librexgpu-xenos.so` from the nightly's commit
  `bd833a2` with `patches/rexglue-sdk/*.patch` into the overlay prefix
  `~/rexglue-sdk-patched/0.10.0.24/linux-amd64` (source checkout `~/rexglue-sdk-src/sdk`); the reach
  build copies it next to the binary after each link (`REACH_XENOS_PLUGIN`). Building the SDK on this
  immutable host uses Homebrew's X11/XCB/Wayland headers (see the script). Upstream will not take GPU
  fixes, so further Xenos fixes go into `patches/rexglue-sdk/` too.
- Clang 23 / CMake / Ninja from Homebrew: `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin`.
- JDK 21: `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec`.
- Build: `cmake -S reach-recomp -B reach-recomp/out/build/linux-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/clang++ -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/rexglue-sdk/linux-amd64` then `ninja -C reach-recomp/out/build/linux-release`.

### Ghidra MCP HTTP API

The headless GhidraMCP server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8089`. Every endpoint takes
`program=/xbox360/default.xex` or `program=/mcc/haloreach.dll`. Endpoint catalog with
params: `~/ghidra-mcp/tests/endpoints.json`. Useful ones:

- `GET /decompile_function?address=0x82....&program=...`
- `POST /disassemble_bytes` JSON `{start_address,end_address,include_instructions:true,program}`
- `GET /get_xrefs_to?address=...&program=...`
- `GET /search_strings?...`, `GET /list_imports`, `GET /list_exports`, `GET /search_functions_by_name`
- `POST /rename_function`, `POST /set_decompiler_comment` (annotate as you learn things)
- `GET /save_program?program=...` after edits

Check exact param names in `endpoints.json` before calling.

## Hard rules

- Never delete, overwrite, or modify the ISO, the zip, `extracted/`, or anything in the Steam/MCC install.
- Never run `rm`, `find -delete`, etc. on user files. Scratch files go in `/tmp`.
- Don't kill the tmux sessions `ghidra-headless`, `ghidra-gui`, `reach-build`.
- Commit your own work in git (`git -c user.name=agent -c user.email=agent@local commit`), docs in `docs/`.

## Status log

- 2026-10-08: ISO extracted. Both binaries imported + analyzed in Ghidra. ReXGlue codegen of
  `default.xex` succeeds (325 files, 167 MB C++) with one manual function hint; warnings in
  `reach-recomp/codegen-warnings.log`. First native build in progress.
- 2026-10-08 (later): `reach` + the four Waves audio DLLs build and boot (GPU plugin xenos,
  cache0/cache1 mounts, 375+ missed entry points pinned via `hints/`). Boot then died in an
  endless null write on the ASYNC_0 thread (`sub_82602C28`): the statically linked XAPI fiber
  code (`SwitchToFiber` = 0x8295DC48) swaps guest GPRs and "returns" into another fiber, which
  recompiled code cannot do. Fixed by mapping the five XAPI fiber routines to the SDK's native
  `rexcrt_*` fibers (`hints/rexcrt.toml`). Implemented `XeCryptBnQwNeRsaPubCrypt`
  (`src/kernel/xecrypt_rsa.cpp`; the SDK stubs it on Linux, the game verifies RSA-2048
  signatures with it). The game now plays the intro Bink video, then shows the (auto-answered)
  storage device selector and writes profile settings; after that the screen stays black.

- 2026-10-08 (evening): moved to the ReXGlue 0.10.0.24 nightly (atomic `stwcx.`, fences, VMX
  pack fix). Fixed a codegen bug where `bdz`/`bdzf` switch-chain tail calls were emitted as bare
  `return`s (`hints/switch_tailcalls.toml` + `src/hooks/switch_tailcalls.cpp`). Ghidra analysis
  repaired (no-return cascade, ~1.6k merged fragments); function names exported to
  `docs/symbols/default_xex_functions.csv`. Credits/rank/Armory mapped in `docs/progression_re.md`.
  Open blocker: the title menu renders black; see `docs/menu_black_screen.md`.

- 2026-10-09: **title menu fixed.** Root cause was an SDK bug, not game state: the SPIR-V
  translator read the texture-fetch `exp_adjust` from fetch-constant word 4 instead of word 3, so with
  Reach's LOD bias every texture sample came back 1/256 as bright (`docs/menu_black_screen.md`).
  Patched plugin built from source (`tools/build_rexglue_sdk.sh`). Title screen and start menu
  (Armory, player card with rank/cR) render. Also fixed: directories marked delete-on-close are now
  deleted (`cache1:\webcache`), and `REACH_NO_SIGNIN=1` mimics Xenia's no-profile setup.

- 2026-10-09 (later): **campaign starts.** START, A on START SOLO CAMPAIGN, A on Normal loads
  Winter Contingency: the loading cinematic, the in-engine opening cinematic (Warthog, Falcon, Noble Team
  briefing) and Noble Six at the base render. Open issue: terrain/foliage show saturated red/green
  patches that change every frame. Traced to the lighting buffer texture (`k_2_10_10_10_AS_16_16_16_16`
  at 0x02354000) that an EDRAM resolve fills; it contains garbage in our build. Two more SDK porting bugs
  found by diffing against Xenia and patched (stacked-texture layer lerp, missing layer clamp), but they
  are not the red-patch cause. Patch 0004: the SDK hosted `k_2_10_10_10` render targets (Reach's HDR
  lighting) as 8-bit `A8B8G8R8` instead of Xenia's `A2B10G10R10`; fixed, red patches remain.
- Xenia can now be driven in-game with `tools/virtual_pad.py` (virtual Xbox 360 pad over /dev/uinput),
  but its campaign needs a Xenia profile (Profile > Create Profile, once). Don't automate the mouse
  for that: ydotool's absolute moves land at (0,0) on this KDE session and hit other windows.
  `renderdoccmd capture` under `timeout` leaves the captured child running; kill it afterwards.

- 2026-10-09 (night): **checkpoint revert crash fixed.** ~4.5 min into the campaign the game reverted
  to a checkpoint and died with "Call to invalid or unregistered function at 0x82429440": a
  post-revert callback (table 0x82A39BF0) is a real function placed right after a call to the
  no-return fatal-error handler, so codegen merged it into its predecessor. `find_missing_entries.py`
  now also accepts data-referenced addresses after a `bl` (and skips `.reloc`);
  `hints/indirect_entries_2.toml` adds 18 such entries. `REACH_GSTRACE=1`
  (`src/debug/gamestate_trace.cpp`) traces game state save/load/verify. Nine more SDK GPU patches
  (0005-0013, from an audit against Xenia; see `docs/sdk_patches.md`). Open: red terrain patches,
  dropped tessellated strips, GPU hang ~5 min in. `REACH_AUTOPRESS` now drives sticks and triggers
  (`300:LSUP:4`, `RT`).

- 2026-10-09 (morning): **red terrain fixed** (SDK patch 0015). The red/green speckle on terrain,
  foliage and stars was a precision loss in the 7e3 -> 8_8_8_8_GAMMA -> 8_8_8_8 EDRAM round trip
  Reach uses for its forward-lit surfaces; one gamma byte came back one lower and the combine
  pass's hand-written 7e3 decode turned that into 2^6 red. Xenia decodes gamma bytes to the
  midpoint of their linear range; ported (`docs/sdk_patches.md` has the full trace). Found by
  capturing the same cinematic shot in both: Xenia uses a profile copied from the user's EmuDeck
  Xenia (`content/E03000003463994D` into `~/.local/share/Xenia/content` plus
  `logged_profile_slot_0_xuid` in its config), driven with `tools/virtual_pad.py -` (reads one
  input per line from stdin, so menus can be stepped while watching screenshots). New RenderDoc
  scripts: `resolves.py`, `phist.py`, `pick.py`, `blend.py`, `savetex.py`, `bufdump.py`.
  Open: faint cyan speckles on near ground in the Falcon landing, dropped indexed tessellated
  strips, GPU hang ~4-5 min in.
- Scripted runs need every SDL pad ignored: with a pad connected (including Steam Input's and
  Sunshine's virtual ones) the scripted presses never reach the campaign. `run_reach.sh` sets
  `SDL_*_IGNORE_DEVICES_EXCEPT` when `REACH_AUTOPRESS` is set; Xenia needs
  `SDL_GAMECONTROLLER_IGNORE_DEVICES=<vid/pid,...>` for the same reason, or the virtual pad
  becomes player 2 (unsigned profile).

- 2026-10-09 (midday): **gameplay reached** (with adaptive tessellation draws skipped by a local
  debug switch). The next crash, "Call to invalid or unregistered function at 0x82853FB0" ~6 min
  in, was a function only reachable through a callback table the game fills at run time
  (`sub_82874A20` indexes it by type), so no static reference exists. Found the caller with gdb
  (`break rex::runtime::InvalidFunctionTrap`, then `bt`). `tools/find_orphan_functions.py`
  lists code no generated function covers and nothing static reaches; `hints/indirect_entries_3.toml`
  registers 138 such functions (11 with an explicit `end`). Seven CRT entries in
  `indirect_entries_2.toml` that split functions are pruned again. Open: the GPU hang on the
  first adaptive-tessellation draw (patch 0016 is part of it), black 3D world in most gameplay
  frames (HUD fine), cyan tint on foliage.

- 2026-10-09 (afternoon): **gameplay renders.** The black 3D world was the SDK defaulting
  `execute_unclipped_draw_vs_on_cpu` to false: an unclipped screen-space draw claimed all of
  EDRAM, a depth buffer took over the scene's tiles and a transfer wiped the scene (SDK patch
  0019 restores Xenia's defaults; trace in `docs/sdk_patches.md`). Patch 0017 sets r0.w = 1 in
  domain shaders as Xenia does; 0018 drops adaptive triangle-patch draws by default
  (`--skip_adaptive_triangle_tessellation=false` to draw them) because the first one still hangs
  the GPU. A default `tools/run_reach.sh` run now plays the opening and reaches the "locate
  distress beacon" objective with the world lit like Xenia. Missing: those tessellated surfaces
  (probably water).

- 2026-10-09 (evening): **Forge works, and the Armory shows the Spartan.**
  - Forge: lobby, map list (Local Files), Sword Base, editing mode, object placement and budget,
    "Save As New Map" (a BLF map variant under `~/.local/share/reach/<xuid>/4D53085B/00000001/`;
    it appears in the lobby and the variant list), ending the game, carnage report, and cR for
    the session.
  - Fixes:
    - The SDK's headless keyboard (`--headless=true`) returned its default text byte-swapped,
      so saved maps were named in CJK glyphs; `src/kernel/xam_keyboard.cpp` overrides
      `XamShowKeyboardUI` in headless mode.
    - The Spartan was missing from the Armory preview and the post-game screens: a full-screen
      rectangle with W = 0 that sets the model's alpha was clipped on the host (SDK patch 0021;
      Xenia has the same gap; trace in `docs/sdk_patches.md`).
  - Open:
    - Once, entering the Forge lobby froze the game: a new guest thread faulted forever on a
      null virtual call inside the runtime's `XThread::Create` start lambda (gdb: the thread
      sat in `ExceptionHandlerCallback`, re-running `mov (%r14),%rax` with r14 = 0). It did not
      reproduce on the next run.
    - D-pad DOWN is sometimes ignored in menus during FIFO sessions (UP works; menus wrap).

- 2026-10-09 (night): **no more water draws; System Link discovery works.**
  - SDK patch 0022: real occlusion query results, without stalling the GPU. The SDK had
    switched host queries off at the first query and answered "visible" to all of them, so
    Reach kept issuing its adaptive-tessellation water every frame (the draw that hangs RADV).
    Now Forge (6 minutes on Sword Base) and the campaign through the Falcon takeoff run at
    30 fps with no water draw issued (patch 0018 still skips it if it comes). Note: the title
    and main menus remember their last selection in the profile, so the default
    `run_reach.sh` presses can land in Forge instead of the campaign. Trace in `docs/sdk_patches.md`.
  - System Link: a codegen jump-table gap froze the game when System Link was selected
    (`hints/switch_tables.toml`). `src/kernel/net.cpp` adds a virtual network
    (`REACH_NET=1`); two instances on one machine list each other's parties. Joining is the
    next step (`docs/online_plan.md`).
  - Debug aids: `REACH_NETTRACE=1` (network calls and datagrams), `REACH_FPSLOG=1` (frame rate
    every 5 s), `REACH_XUID` / `REACH_GAMERTAG` (a second identity).

- 2026-10-09 (late night): **System Link plays; challenges offline.**
  - System Link: the XamEnumerate completion codes (a content enumeration retried forever and
    blocked joins) and 360-style secure addresses (0.x.y.z) were the last blockers; two
    instances join one lobby and play Firefight together (`docs/online_plan.md`).
  - Daily/weekly challenges without Bungie's servers: picked from the date, shown in the
    START menu, saved per profile (`docs/progression_re.md` 4.1). Progress counting in play
    is not verified yet.

- 2026-10-09 (late night): **internet play through Reach Live.** `server/reach_live_server.py`
  (self-hostable, standard-library Python) plus a Live mode in `src/kernel/net.cpp`
  (`REACH_SERVER=host`): players on a server see each other's System Link games, join and play
  Firefight, directly via UDP hole punching or relayed by the server (about 4 KB/s for a
  two-player match). Each player gets a persistent online identity
  (`src/kernel/identity.cpp`). `docs/online_plan.md` section 5.

- 2026-10-09 (late night): **keyboard and mouse.** A synthetic device on guest user 0
  (`src/input/kbm.cpp`, merged with any pad) with bindings for Reach's Default layout, and
  mouse look applied as an angle inside player control (`sub_8247C978`) after the stick's
  acceleration and turn-rate cap, keeping zoom scaling and inversion
  (`src/hooks/mouse_look.cpp`, `hints/mouse_look.toml`). Verified with the FIFO's new
  `MOUSE:dx,dy` / `KEY:name` commands: 1636 counts turn exactly 90° (30° through the 3x DMR
  scope), pitch clamps at straight up/down, fire/zoom/swap/jump/crouch/move and menu keys work.
  `docs/input.md`.

- 2026-10-09 (late night): **emulated Xbox LIVE and keyboard/mouse.**
  - Reach Live signs the profile in to "Xbox LIVE" (on by default with a server): friends
    roster from the server, presence, session search, QoS game details; a friend joins a
    Firefight lobby from the roster and they play the match (`docs/online_plan.md` 5.2).
    Bungie's title servers: rewards sync answered by the server (5.1).
  - System Link through the server: Slayer on Sword Base with three players; host
    migration works.
  - Keyboard and mouse with direct mouse look (`docs/input.md`).
  - SDK patch 0020 also moves the viz-query logs to debug level (1000+ lines a second).

- 2026-10-09 (night, later): **challenges verified, a freeze fixed, File Share.**
  - Offline challenges count real kills and pay out on completion (`docs/progression_re.md` 4.1).
  - A Firefight freeze was a lost wakeup in the SDK's critical sections (a guest event
    header shared by two objects); `src/kernel/critical_section.cpp` replaces them
    (`docs/sdk_patches.md`, "Runtime fixes").
  - File Share through Reach Live: upload from Forge, browse a friend's share from the
    roster, download (`docs/online_plan.md` 5.3).

- 2026-10-10 (night): **Windows build runs; README covers building and playing.**
  - `tools/build_windows.sh` cross-compiles the patched SDK (Vulkan on) and the game with
    clang/clang-cl + xwin and packages `reach-recomp/out/dist/windows`. Under Proton 10 the
    game plays the intro and reaches the first-run Armory screen with the Vulkan backend.
  - It first hung at startup in our RtlEnterCriticalSection: on Windows the runtime maps
    guest addresses >= 0xE0000000 0x1000 bytes further on (64 KB mapping granularity), so
    `base + addr` in our code missed the SDK's VdHSIOCalibrationLock (0xFFCAB000). All our
    guest pointers now use `GuestPtr(base, addr)` (`src/platform/guest_memory.h`).
    Found with gdb on the Wine process: the user-mode RSP of a thread blocked in a syscall
    is in Wine's syscall frame (`*(gs:0x328) + 0x88`); scanning that stack for return
    addresses and symbolizing them with a `/DEBUG` PDB named the waiting function.
  - The SDK cross build needs the MSVC headers after clang's (`-idirafter`), or the SSE
    intrinsics become undefined external functions.
  - A fresh clone now builds with one configure + build (the first configure runs codegen).
  - The README has requirements, Linux and Windows build steps, playing, running a Reach Live
    server (Python or Docker; checked with podman) and troubleshooting.

- 2026-10-10: **Release builds in CI, private.** The private codegen repo
  (`DecompiledHaloReach-generated`) has `.github/workflows/release.yml` (Actions → Release →
  Run workflow, or push a `v*` tag there). It checks out this repo at the commit the private
  README records, copies the generated code in, builds Linux on ubuntu-22.04 (glibc 2.35 floor;
  Homebrew clang 23 against GCC 13's libstdc++, as the SDK nightly) and Windows (the
  `tools/build_windows.sh` cross build; xwin splats the MSVC CRT in CI), and publishes
  `RecompiledHaloReach-linux-x64.tar.gz`, `RecompiledHaloReach-windows-x64.zip` and checksums
  as a release of that private repo. The binaries contain translated game code: never attach
  them to this repo. It refuses a commit whose manifest or hints differ from the ones the code
  was generated with: after changing hints, regenerate and run `tools/sync_generated_repo.sh`.
  - Pieces here: `-DREACH_SKIP_CODEGEN=ON` (compile a supplied `generated/`),
    `tools/package_linux.sh` (flat package with `play.sh DATA_DIR`), `tools/build_rexglue_sdk.sh
    --source-only`.
  - Cost: first run about 55 runner minutes (Windows SDK 15 min, Windows game 8-16 min, Linux
    plugin 5 min, Linux game 7-15 min; GitHub's 2-vCPU runners vary 2x). With the SDK trees,
    the xwin splat and ccache (PCH-aware, depend mode) cached, a release whose generated code
    is unchanged takes about 9 minutes.
  - The game rejects an option given twice (CLI11), so wrappers must not add `--log_file` when
    the caller passes one.

- 2026-10-10: **No more tearing; frame-time statistics.** A shimmer crawling down the menus
  was tearing: the SDK presents with IMMEDIATE, KWin lets fullscreen games tear, and the
  tear line of a 30 fps image on a 144 Hz display lands at a new height every frame. Guest
  frames dumped three times a second on the title and main menus have no moving band. The
  game now defaults the SDK's present-mode settings to FIFO (`src/main.cpp`); MAILBOX was not
  chosen because the SDK's UI thread repaints nonstop on Linux (thousands of presents a
  second without a vsync wait, each rebuilding a pipeline). On a quiet machine FIFO takes the
  GPU from 44% to 21% busy on the main menu and from 55% to 32% in a SWAT game, the game's CPU
  use from 2.4 to 1.8 cores (menu), and the game holds 30.0 fps either way. `RECOMP_PERF=1`
  (`src/debug/frame_stats.cpp`, replacing `REACH_FPSLOG`) logs fps, percentiles, 1% lows,
  stutters and new pipelines for guest frames and host presents; `tools/bench.sh` measures
  the main menu or a Custom Game, warm or cold (`docs/perf.md`). The nonstop repaint came
  from the SDK's achievement toast dialog, always registered with the ImGui drawer; it is
  now registered only while a toast shows (`src/platform/achievement_toast.cpp`), and the
  window is repainted once per guest frame in every present mode.

## Debugging recipes

- Run: `tools/run_reach.sh <secs> [flags]` (logs `/tmp/reach_run.log`, rotates at 5 MB). It skips
  the intro by pressing START at 9 s (`REACH_AUTOPRESS`, the title screen is up by ~15 s) and removes
  orphaned `/dev/shm/xenia_memory_*` (5 GB each; leaked ones fill /dev/shm and every later run dies
  with SIGBUS).
- GPU differential debugging with RenderDoc (how the black menu was solved): capture ours with
  `REACH_RDCAPTURE=<secs>` under `renderdoccmd capture` (layer setup in `docs/menu_black_screen.md`),
  capture Xenia with `tools/renderdoc/trigger_capture.py`, then run the `tools/renderdoc/*.py`
  scripts with `qrenderdoc --python` to match draws, diff constants/textures/interpolators, and
  swap in instrumented SPIR-V (`instrument.py`) to see intermediate register values.
  Load times vary by tens of seconds between runs (more under RenderDoc), so fixed capture times
  miss shots: set `REACH_RDCAPTURE_TRIGGER=<file>` and touch that file to capture (the file is
  polled every 10 swaps and deleted), e.g. from a loop that converts periodic `REACH_FRAMEDUMP`s
  and checks them. `/tmp` is RAM-backed here; delete captures you are done with.
- Stepping through menus by hand: `tools/live_session.sh DIR` starts the game in the
  background with an input FIFO; `tools/live_step.sh DIR WAIT [INPUT...]` presses inputs
  (`A`, `UP`, `START:0.5`), waits and writes a screenshot to `DIR/last.png`;
  `tools/menu_state.py title|main PNG` reads which title/main menu item is highlighted (the
  game remembers the last choice in the profile, so never count presses). `--headless=true`
  answers system dialogs (keyboard, device selector) with their defaults, which scripted
  Forge saves need; without it they are ImGui overlays that frame dumps don't show. If
  `live_step.sh` prints "no frame", the game has stopped presenting.
- System Link on one machine: `tools/system_link_pair.sh DIR_A DIR_B` starts two instances
  with the virtual network (`REACH_NET=1`; the second gets its own profile, XUID and
  gamertag via `REACH_INSTANCE=2`), makes A host a Firefight lobby and selects A's party on
  B. `echo X:0.3 > DIR_B/in.fifo` presses "Join". `REACH_NETTRACE=packets` logs datagrams.
- Through a Reach Live server: start `server/reach_live_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --http-port
  21101`, then `REACH_SERVER=127.0.0.1 tools/system_link_pair.sh DIR_A DIR_B` (profiles in
  `DIR_A/data`, `DIR_B/data`; keep them on disk, not in RAM-backed `/tmp`).
  `REACH_SERVER_RELAY=1` forces the relay path. `curl localhost:21101` shows players and
  relayed bytes.
- `tools/live_shot.sh DIR` saves what the window shows (the presenter's output, at the draw
  resolution scale) as `DIR/shot.png`; `live_step.sh` frame dumps read guest memory and stay
  at 1152×720. `live_session.sh` removes orphaned `/dev/shm/xenia_memory_*` files before
  starting (killed instances leave 5 GB each; a full /dev/shm kills new instances with SIGBUS).
- `qrenderdoc --python` crashes with "Illegal instruction" under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`;
  run it without that variable.
- Each instance takes about 6 GB of RAM and 5 GB of `/dev/shm`. `REACH_NETTRACE=1` logs every
  network call; prefer `REACH_NETTRACE=packets` for long runs (logs go to RAM-backed `/tmp`).
- Frame rate and stutter: `tools/bench.sh menu|gameplay [--cold]`, or `RECOMP_PERF=1` in any
  run (`docs/perf.md`). Measure only with no other game running (it prints `CONTENDED`
  otherwise).
- Frame dumps without screenshots: `REACH_FRAMEDUMP=20,28` + `--vulkan_readback_resolve=true`, then
  `tools/frame_to_png.py`. Texture binding trace: `REACH_TEXTRACE=1`. Live guest memory: `tools/guestmem.py`.
  `--gpu_allow_invalid_fetch_constants=true` silences thousands of fetch-constant warnings.
- Find the guest function behind an "Unhandled guest access violation": run under gdb with
  `catch signal SIGSEGV` conditioned on `$_siginfo._sifields._sigfault.si_addr` (guest address
  `X` is host `0x100000000 + X`); the backtrace shows `__imp__sub_XXXXXXXX` frames with
  generated source lines. Other SIGSEGVs are normal (MMIO / GPU write watches), so pass them.
- Stall diagnosis: `gdb -p $(pgrep -x reach) -batch -ex 'thread apply all bt 30'`; guest
  frames appear as `sub_XXXXXXXX`.
- Screenshots: `spectacle -b -n -a -o shot.png` while the game window is focused.
- Kernel imports can be overridden from `src/` by defining `extern "C" REX_FUNC(__imp__Name)`
  (generated code calls `__imp__Name` directly; the executable's definition wins).
- Shader stores (ours: `~/.local/share/reach/cache/shaders/shareable/4D53085B.xsh`, Xenia:
  `~/.local/share/Xenia/cache_host/...`): `tools/xsh_fetches.py STORE [HASH..]` lists texture/vertex
  fetch slots per shader; `--dump_shaders=<dir>` writes microcode disassembly.
- Ghidra: `tools/ghidra_scripts/ReachFixSaveRestHelpers.java` repairs prologue-truncated
  functions (run via `/run_script_inline`; the headless server must be started with
  `GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS=1`). Decompile endpoint is `/force_decompile`.
