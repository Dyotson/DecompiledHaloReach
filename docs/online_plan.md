# P2P online: findings and plan

Status (2026-10-09, late night): M0-M4 done. Players connect to a self-hosted **Reach Live
server** (section 5) and play together over the internet in two ways:

- **Xbox LIVE (emulated, the default with a server):** the profile is signed in to "Xbox
  LIVE"; lobbies are open to friends, and every other player on the server is a friend. The
  lobby roster lists them with their game ("In Firefight Lobby 1/16") and "Join" works:
  presence, session search, QoS game details and the secure connection are answered by our
  layer (section 5.2). Verified: a friend joins a Firefight lobby from the roster and both
  play the match; a Slayer custom game on Sword Base played to its time limit goes through
  the postgame (Credits earned), the carnage report and back to the shared lobby.
- **System Link:** every connected player's System Link games appear in the game's own
  browser (also on one machine with `REACH_NET=1`, the virtual network in section 4).
  Verified: Firefight with two players, Slayer on Sword Base with three, host migration
  (killing the host mid-match: the other player sees "Waiting for host…", becomes the host
  and the match goes on).

Traffic goes directly between players through UDP hole punching, or through the server when
that fails. Not yet tried: separate machines across real NATs.
Not available: matchmaking (signed playlists, section 5.1), file share, Xbox LIVE party.
`tools/system_link_pair.sh` sets up a pair (with `REACH_SERVER` set, through a server).
"Guess" marks statements not confirmed by code or a run.

## Progress log

- **System Link froze the game.** Selecting it ran the network session state machine
  `sub_82276B90`, whose 10-entry jump table codegen had recovered as one entry, so state 2+
  hit `__builtin_trap()` forever. Fixed with `hints/switch_tables.toml`.
- **Link status.** `XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus` returning a link makes "SYSTEM LINK GAMES"
  appear in Network Mode.
- **Ports.** Binding guest port 1000 fails on Linux (privileged). The virtual network never
  binds guest ports on the host: each instance owns one UDP port in 21000-21007 and
  multiplexes guest ports over it with an 8-byte header.
- **XNetRandom.** The SDK fills 0xBB, so every instance generated the same session nonce and
  dropped the other's discovery broadcasts as its own. Random bytes fixed discovery: each
  instance answers the other's 13-byte `broadcast-search` with a 151/165-byte
  `broadcast-reply`.
- **Identity.** Every SDK profile is XUID 0xB13EBABEBABEBABE "User"; `REACH_XUID` and
  `REACH_GAMERTAG` override them (`src/kernel/xam_signin.cpp`). A second instance needs its
  own `XDG_DATA_HOME` too.
- **Join.** X ("Join User") stores a deferred join record (`sub_822C6050`, record at
  0x832FAD00), which the per-frame network join update `sub_82200A00` picks up. That update
  was skipped forever: the SDK completes an asynchronous `XamEnumerate` that has run out of
  items with the raw error, while the console (and Xenia) completes it with
  ERROR_FUNCTION_FAILED plus the error as an HRESULT in the extended error. Reach's content
  enumeration accepted only the console's form, so it restarted about five times a second
  and kept a "content operation in flight" flag up (byte 0x8391DEB8), which gates the join
  update. `src/kernel/xam_enumerate.cpp` fixes the completion codes. Now the joiner registers
  the host's key, resolves its address, waits 8 s without sending anything but discovery,
  then sent join-abort (out-of-band message 10). The wait was for a secure connection that
  never started: Reach calls `XNetConnect` only for addresses whose first byte is 0
  (`sub_82273FD0`), which is what XNetXnAddrToInAddr returns on a 360, and our virtual IPs
  were 10.77.0.N. With 0.77.0.N the joiner connects, sends join-request (message 8, first
  byte 0x90) to the host's port 1001, the host connects back and the session traffic
  (membership, parameters, players) flows on port 1000.
- **Discovery packets** are Blam bitstreams: a 13-byte `broadcast-search` (type byte, a
  constant, 8-byte nonce) and a 151-169-byte `broadcast-reply` echoing the nonce and carrying,
  bit-packed, the host's XNADDR, the game mode name in UTF-16 and the host's XUID.
  `REACH_NETTRACE=packets` logs them without the call trace.

## 1. What Reach imports

Only `default.xex` imports networking; the four guest DLLs import none. The import thunks
are in `reach-recomp/generated/default`.

**Sockets:**

- `NetDll_WSAStartup`, `WSACleanup`, `WSAGetLastError`, `__WSAFDIsSet`
- `socket`, `bind`, `connect`, `listen`, `accept`, `select`, `setsockopt`, `ioctlsocket`
- `send`, `recv`, `sendto`, `recvfrom`, `shutdown`, `closesocket`, `inet_addr`

**XNet:**

- `XNetStartup`, `XNetCleanup`, `XNetRandom`
- `XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus`, `XNetGetTitleXnAddr`
- `XNetCreateKey`, `XNetRegisterKey`, `XNetUnregisterKey`
- `XNetXnAddrToInAddr`, `XNetInAddrToXnAddr`, `XNetUnregisterInAddr`, `XNetXnAddrToMachineId`
- `XNetConnect`, `XNetGetConnectStatus`, `XNetServerToInAddr`
- `XNetQosListen`, `XNetQosLookup`, `XNetQosServiceLookup`, `XNetQosRelease`,
  `XNetQosGetListenStats`
- `XNetLogonGetMachineID`, `XNetLogonGetTitleID`

**XAM:**

- `XamSessionCreateHandle`, `XamSessionRefObjByHandle`
- `XamVoiceCreate`, `XamVoiceSubmitPacket`, `XamVoiceHeadsetPresent`, `XamVoiceClose`
- `XamUserAreUsersFriends`, `XamShowFriendRequestUI`

**XSession / XUser.** These have no imports of their own: the XDK library compiles them into
`XMsgStartIORequest` / `XMsgInProcessCall` messages to the XAM "apps". The call sites and IDs
come from the `li r3` / `lis+ori r4` sequences in front of each call:

| App | Message | Wrapper | Meaning (from the SDK / Xenia handlers) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0xFB XGI | 0xB0006, 0xB0007, 0xB0008 | 82803580, 82803610, 82803490 | UserSetContext, UserSetProperty, WriteAchievements |
| 0xFB | 0xB0010 | 829219C0 | XSessionCreate (after `XamSessionCreateHandle`) |
| 0xFB | 0xB0011 | 82921C30 | XSessionDelete |
| 0xFB | 0xB0012 | 82921CE0 | XSessionJoinLocal/Remote |
| 0xFB | 0xB0013 | 82921D90 | probably XSessionLeave (guess from numbering). **The SDK has no case**: logs "Unimplemented XGI message" and returns X_E_FAIL (`apps/xgi_app.cpp:450`) |
| 0xFB | 0xB0014, 0xB0015 | 82921F18, 82921FB8 | XSessionStart, XSessionEnd |
| 0xFB | 0xB0018, 0xB001A, 0xB001D, 0xB001E | 82921B70, 82921E38, 82922920, 82922A50 | Modify, ArbitrationRegister, GetDetails, MigrateHost |
| 0xFB | 0xB0021, 0xB0025 | 82803740, 82922180 | UserReadStats, SessionWriteStats |
| 0xFB | 0xB0060, 0xB0065, 0xB0071 | 82922240, 82922068, 82803508 | SearchByIds, SearchWeighted, AwardAvatarAssets |
| 0xFC XLiveBase | 0x58004, 0x58006, 0x5800E, 0x58019, 0x5801E, 0x58020, 0x58023, 0x58044, 0x58046 | 82922548, 820BA2E8, 82922878, 82921248, 82921500, 82920A90, 82920BF0, 82921640, 829213C8 | LogonId, NAT type, friends/presence (Live only) |
| 0xFA XMP, 0xFE XAM | 0x7001A/B, 0x21012, 0x20021 | | music player, guest sign-in, device type |

The game drives all XSession calls from one task dispatcher, `sub_82301800`:

| Op | Calls |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Create: game flags are mapped to XSESSION_CREATE_* bits; gated by `Function_821E76B0`, possibly "is a Live session" (guess) |
| 1 | GetDetails, then Delete |
| 2 | MigrateHost |
| 3 | Modify |
| 4 | Join |
| 5 | Leave |
| 6 | Start |
| 7 | End |

`sub_822B7608` calls Join/Leave/Modify directly too.

## 2. What the SDK does with them today

| Area | SDK behaviour (`src/kernel/xam/xam_net.cpp`, `src/system/xsocket.cpp`) | Effect on Reach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Link status | `XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus` returns 0 (`:508`) | `sub_822738D0`, which creates a session key, only succeeds when the link status is non-zero **and** `XNetCreateKey` returns 0. Otherwise only offline sessions exist, so System Link cannot work |
| XNADDR | `XNetGetTitleXnAddr`: loopback IP, MAC `CC×6` for every instance (`:438`) | two instances would look identical |
| Address mapping | `XNetXnAddrToInAddr` / `InAddrToXnAddr` return 1 (failure) (`:481`, `:488`) | `Function_82273988` turns a peer's XNADDR into an IP:port; it fails |
| Keys, connect | `XNetCreateKey`, `RegisterKey`, `UnregisterKey`, `Connect`, `GetConnectStatus`, `QosLookup`, `ServerToInAddr`, `UnregisterInAddr`, `QosGetListenStats` are `REX_EXPORT_STUB` (`:1036-1054`) | `REX_STUB` leaves r3 untouched, so each "returns" its first argument: the XDK wrappers' caller id, 1, which reads as failure |
| QoS | `XNetQosListen` returns `X_ERROR_FUNCTION_FAILED` (`:560`); `XNetQosServiceLookup` succeeds with no data | |
| Sockets | Real host sockets. VDP (protocol 254) becomes plain UDP (`xsocket.cpp:50`). The secure-key options 0x5801/0x5802 are swallowed; `SO_BROADCAST` passes through. No XNet encryption and no port remapping (`xsocket.cpp:117`) | Binding 1000/1001 fails for a normal user: `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` is 1024 on this host |
| XSession | The XGI handlers log their arguments and return success without filling `XSESSION_INFO` or the nonce (`apps/xgi_app.cpp:96-116`); 0xB0013 fails; `XamSessionRefObjByHandle` returns a dummy object (`xam_user.cpp:720`) | Fine for offline; a host would advertise an empty session id/key |
| Identity | Every instance has XUID `0xB13EBABEBABEBABE` (`src/system/xam/user_profile.cpp:28`) | two local instances collide |

Xenia Canary mainline `82d0cd1f4` is not better here: `xam_net.cc` and `apps/xgi_app.cc` have
the same stubs. The XSession messages say "implemented in netplay".

The netplay fork has the missing layer:

- **XNet** (`src/xenia/kernel/xam/xam_net.cc`, 2,723 lines):
  - `XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus` returns ACTIVE | 100MBPS | FULL_DUPLEX unless offline (`:1064`).
  - `XNetGetTitleXnAddr` fills the real LAN IP, the public IP and a persistent MAC (`:696`).
  - `XNetXnAddrToInAddr` returns `xnaddr.ina` in System Link mode and `inaOnline` in Live mode;
    its own MAC maps to loopback (`:882`).
  - `XNetCreateKey` generates a session id with type `XNKID_SYSTEM_LINK` (0x00 in the top
    nibble, `xnet.h:1508`) (`:2615`).
  - `XNetRegisterKey` records the System Link id (`:2628`).
  - `XNetConnect` sleeps 150 ms and succeeds (`:786`); `GetConnectStatus` returns CONNECTED
    (`:796`).
  - QoS lookups go through the server.
- **Sockets** (`xsocket.cc`, 1,365 lines): guest-to-host port remapping on
  bind/connect/sendto/recvfrom (`:256`, `:280`, `:516`, `:1208`; tables in `upnp.h:137-143`),
  plus UPnP port forwarding.
- **Sessions** (`xsession.cc`, 1,367 lines): System Link and Live sessions.
- **Live backend** (`XLiveAPI.cpp`, 2,606 lines): a central web service (`api_address`, default
  list `xenia-netplay-...herokuapp.com`) for matchmaking, sessions, QoS data, friends and
  presence.
- **Modes**: `network_mode` 0 offline / 1 System Link / 2 Live (`XLiveAPI.cpp:41`);
  `bind_interface` picks the adapter, for tunnels/VPNs.

What a port would take: our SDK keeps Xenia's structure (`XSocket`, XGI/XLiveBase apps,
`REX_EXPORT` entry points), so these functions move over almost one-to-one. We can't change the
SDK binary's exports, so they would live either in `patches/rexglue-sdk` or as `__imp__`
overrides in `reach-recomp/src/` (the pattern of `xam_signin.cpp` and `xam_keyboard.cpp`).
Overrides avoid rebuilding `librexruntime.so`, which we don't ship (see
`tools/build_rexglue_sdk.sh`). The SDK's XGI and XSocket internals are reachable from our code
only through exported symbols, so a self-contained net layer in our tree is simpler than
patching them.

## 3. How Reach's system link works (as far as the code shows)

- **Endpoints.** `sub_822F9F98` opens two endpoints through `sub_822F9D80`:
  - port **1000** with transport mode 1;
  - port **1001** with mode 0 and the flag that makes `sub_822F9D80` set
    `SO_BROADCAST` (`setsockopt(s, 0xFFFF, 0x20)`).
- **Socket modes.** `sub_822A5020` maps mode 0 to UDP (17), mode 1 to **VDP (254)** and mode 2
  to TCP (6), all over AF_INET. So game traffic is VDP on 1000 and discovery is UDP broadcast
  on 1001 (the broadcast-to-1001 detail is a guess from the flags, but consistent).
- **Transport flags.** Both endpoints require the flags at 0x82BD2820/0x82BD2821.
  `sub_82274328` initialises the transport: `XNetStartup` with 16 datagram sockets, 24 stream
  sockets, 10 key registrations and 75 security associations, then `WSAStartup`.
  `sub_822742C0` polls the link status: bit 0 means active, and bit 5 (wireless) is stored at
  0x82BD2823. `Function_822741F8` shuts the transport down.
- **Out-of-band message types** (`Function_823262C0`):

  | Type | Name | Size |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 0 | `ping` | 12 bytes |
  | 1 | `pong` | 12 bytes |
  | 2 | `broadcast-search` | 16 bytes |
  | 3 | `broadcast-reply` | 0x1280 bytes (presumably the game description) |

  Session messages follow, as in Halo 3: `connect-request/refuse/establish/closed`,
  `join-request`, `peer-connect`, `join-refuse/abort`, `leave-session`, `session-boot/disband`,
  `host-handoff`, `membership-update`, `peer-properties`, `parameters-update/request`, and so
  on (strings at 0x82051F94..0x820524D8).
- **Addressing.** A peer is addressed by XNADDR plus session id: `Function_82273988` calls
  `XNetXnAddrToInAddr(xnaddr, xnkid)` and builds {IP, port, family 4} from the result. The host
  creates the session key with `XNetCreateKey` (`sub_822738D0`); joiners register it with
  `XNetRegisterKey` (`sub_822B8E20`, `sub_822B91F0`) and connect with `XNetConnect`
  (`sub_82273B80`, `sub_822AB038`).
- **QoS.** `XNetQosListen` (4 sites) / `XNetQosLookup` (`sub_8226D1D0`) are probably only used
  by Live matchmaking (strings `qos-*`, `matchmaking-*`); the broadcast reply carries what system
  link needs (guess).
- **No encryption is needed between our own instances.** On a 360, XNet encrypts VDP with the
  registered key. Between two copies of this port, both ends skip that, so VDP payloads (2-byte
  game-data length + data + voice) can pass through unchanged. Talking to real 360s or Xenia is
  out of scope.

## 4. Plan

Design choice: a small **virtual network layer** in `reach-recomp/src/net/`, not raw host
sockets.

- **One host UDP socket per instance.** The guest sockets (ports 1000/1001, plus any the game
  opens later) are multiplexed over it with a 4-byte header: guest source port and destination
  port.
- **Virtual addresses.** Every instance gets a virtual IPv4 (e.g. `10.77.0.N`) and a unique MAC
  for its XNADDR. `XNetXnAddrToInAddr` returns the virtual IP; the layer maps it to the peer's
  real `ip:port`.
- **Broadcast** to `255.255.255.255:1001` is sent to every known peer.
- **Why this shape.**
  - No privileged ports and no port collisions, so two instances run on one machine.
  - Only one port to forward or hole-punch.
  - LAN and internet differ only in how peers are found: local broadcast on the host port vs a
    rendezvous server.

Milestones:

- **M0 – observe.** Make every XNet/XSession/socket call log at info level (our `__imp__`
  overrides can wrap the SDK). Record the sequence when the lobby's "Select Network" (Y) is
  opened and System Link is chosen. Confirm what greys out System Link today (expected: link
  status 0).
- **M1 – System Link available on one instance.** Override:
  - `XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus` → `0x0B`;
  - `XNetGetTitleXnAddr` → virtual IP, a per-instance MAC and STATIC|ETHERNET flags;
  - `XNetCreateKey`, `RegisterKey`, `UnregisterKey`, `XnAddrToInAddr`, `InAddrToXnAddr`,
    `UnregisterInAddr` (map-based), plus `Connect` and `GetConnectStatus`;
  - `XNetQosListen` → success.

  Add the XGI 0xB0013 handler and fill `XSESSION_INFO` (id, host XNADDR, key) in
  XSessionCreate in case System Link uses it (find out in M0). Add per-instance identity:
  `REACH_XUID` / gamertag overrides, and separate profiles via `--user_data_root` or
  `XDG_DATA_HOME` (`runtime.cpp:32`, `filesystem_posix.cpp:108`).

  Done when a System Link lobby can be hosted and the 1000/1001 endpoints are bound through the
  virtual layer.
- **M2 – two instances see each other on one machine.** Use a static peer list from an env var.
  Done when instance B's System Link browser lists A's game (`broadcast-search` /
  `broadcast-reply` observed in the log). Drive both with `REACH_AUTOPRESS_FIFO`, one FIFO
  each.
- **M3 – a game starts and plays.** Join, membership updates, map load, gameplay, ending, host
  leaving / host migration. Measure bandwidth and latency through the layer.
- **M4 – internet.** Done as Reach Live (section 5): rooms, each instance registers the
  public endpoint the server observes, UDP hole punching through it, and a relay fallback for
  symmetric NAT; self-hostable Python, no Microsoft services. Optionally add UPnP, as in the
  fork.
- **M5 – polish.**
  - Room and peer UI.
  - Voice: `XamVoice*` are SDK stubs today, so VDP voice payloads would need a host voice path.
  - Version checks: the game already rejects mismatched builds (`host-version-too-low`).

Testing on one machine:

- Two instances need about 2 × 6 GB RAM and 2 × 5 GB of `/dev/shm`, which is a 16 GB tmpfs
  here. Both instances also share the GPU.
- With the virtual layer no namespaces are needed: give each instance its own host port.
- To test raw sockets instead, user namespaces are enabled (`max_user_namespaces` = 125748), so
  `unshare --user --map-root-user --net` gives each instance its own network stack. Inside it,
  binding port 1000 is allowed. Linking two namespaces needs a veth pair created inside a shared
  user namespace, or `slirp4netns`.

Risks:

- The game may expect XNet behaviour our stubs don't show: connect status transitions, key
  limits (10 registered keys), or `XNetUnregisterInAddr` timing.
- Session creation may need a real `XSESSION_INFO` even on System Link (open; M0 answers it).
- The intermittent runtime hang seen when entering the Forge lobby (`docs/PROJECT.md`) would
  also hit network sessions.
- Determinism and simulation model: not investigated. Both ends run the same binary, so
  differences between the recompilation and a 360 do not matter between our own instances.
- Interoperability with real consoles, Xenia or Xenia netplay is not a goal; it would need
  XNet encryption, or the fork's server protocol.

Possibly useful later: the Ghidra project also has `haloreach.dll` open (MCC's PC build, with
its own network layer). It may help name Blam network functions; it is not needed for the
plan above.

## 5. Reach Live (custom servers)

Players connect to a community-run server instead of Xbox Live:

```sh
python3 server/reach_live_server.py --port 21100 --http-port 21101   # on the server
REACH_SERVER=example.org tools/run_reach.sh 3600                         # each player
```

- **Server** (`server/reach_live_server.py`, Python standard library only, one UDP port):
  registers players, forwards System Link broadcasts to everyone in the same room, relays
  datagrams between players that can't reach each other, and tells each player its public
  address. `--http-port` serves a JSON status page (players, rooms, relay totals).
  `server/test_reach_live_server.py` tests the protocol.
- **Client** (`src/kernel/net.cpp`): `REACH_SERVER=host[:port]` turns on the virtual network
  in Live mode. Options: `REACH_ROOM=name` (only players in the same room see each other),
  `REACH_NET_PORT=n` (fixed local UDP port, for a manual port forward),
  `REACH_SERVER_RELAY=1` (never connect directly; for testing), `REACH_NET_LAN=1` (also
  broadcast on the LAN).
- **Identity** (`src/kernel/identity.cpp`): the first Live run writes
  `~/.local/share/reach/4D53085B/live_identity.txt` with an online-style XUID
  (`0009xxxxxxxxxxxx`) and a gamertag (the login name; edit the file to change it).
  `REACH_GAMERTAG` / `REACH_XUID` override it. The game shows these in lobbies.
- **Addresses.** A Live player's XNADDR carries the id the server gave it (`ina` =
  `0xF0000000 | id`, `inaOnline` = public IP, `wPortOnline` = server epoch). Peers map it to a
  virtual IP 0.77.x.y as for LAN peers; the network layer routes that IP to the player's
  direct path or through the server.
- **NAT traversal.** When a player first hears from another (any forwarded datagram), both
  send `punch` packets to the other's public and LAN addresses every 300 ms for 6 s; the
  first that arrives opens the direct path (and is answered). Without one, traffic keeps
  going through the server; a new attempt can start after 30 s.

Protocol (UDP, big-endian; every packet starts with `RLV1` and a type byte):

| Type | Direction | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 hello | client → server, every 5 s | version u16, process token u64, XUID u64, LAN IP u32, LAN port u16, room (u8 length + bytes), gamertag (u8 length + UTF-8) |
| 2 welcome | server → client | player id u32, server epoch u16, public IP u32, public port u16, message (u16 length + bytes) |
| 3 error | server → client | code u8 (1 not registered, 2 version, 3 full), text (u16 length + bytes) |
| 4 broadcast | client → server | guest source port u16, guest destination port u16, payload |
| 5 relay | client → server | destination player id u32, guest ports, payload |
| 6 forward | server → client | source player id u32, its public IP u32 + port u16, its LAN IP u32 + port u16, guest ports, payload |
| 7 punch / 8 punch-ack | player ↔ player | sender id u32, receiver id u32, server epoch u16 |
| 9 data | player ↔ player | sender id u32, guest ports, payload |
| 10 bye, 11 list / 12 peers | | leaving; who is in the room |

Measured on one machine (relay forced with `REACH_SERVER_RELAY=1`): a Firefight match between
two players is about 4 KB/s and 60 packets/s through the server in total, so a small VPS can
relay many games. The lobby, the join and the match work both directly and relayed.

Settings: the same options live in `reach.toml` next to the executable and in the F4
settings overlay under "Network/Reach Live" (`live_server`, `live_signin`, `live_room`,
`gamertag`); the environment variables override them. Changes apply on the next start.

### 5.1 Title servers ("LSP")

Bungie ran Reach's online services as Xbox Live title servers ("LSP"): HTTP/1.0 over TCP.
With Live sign-in (the default with a server) the Reach Live server's HTTP port plays that role
(`src/kernel/live_lsp.cpp`, `src/kernel/live_tcp.cpp`, `server/reach_live_lsp.py`).

- **Discovery.** The game enumerates title servers with XTitleServerCreateEnumerator (XAM
  enumerator: app 0xFC, open message 0x58039, items X_TITLE_SERVER {inaServer, flags,
  szServerInfo[200]}, 0xD0 bytes; the SDK refused it). The LSP manager splits each
  description at `,` and matches the tokens against its eight service names (4-byte strings
  at 0x8325114C from the network configuration: `ttl,usr,shr,upl,web,prs,std,dbg`), so the
  one server we return names all of them (`Function_82271658`). It then calls
  XNetServerToInAddr(ina, 0x4D530064) and connects to a random port of the configured range
  (1011-1026, `Lsp_ResolveServerAddress` 0x82271E38); net.cpp sends any TCP connection to
  the server's address to its HTTP port.
- **TCP.** The SDK's host TCP sockets passed the Windows FIONBIO code to Linux and set no
  Winsock errors, so `ioctlsocket` failed and the game closed every connection before
  `connect` (transport code `sub_822A4C58`: socket, FIONBIO, connect expecting
  WSAEWOULDBLOCK, select). With the virtual network on, stream sockets are host TCP sockets
  with Winsock semantics in `live_tcp.cpp`.
- **HTTP.** Requests: `GET path HTTP/1.0` or `POST` with `multipart/form-data;
  boundary=BUNGIEr0x0rz` (one part named `upload`, content type `application/x-reach-*`).
  The reply parser accepts `HTTP/1.0 ` / `HTTP/1.1 ` and reads `Content-Length: `.
  Payloads are BLF files: `_blf` (0x30, v1.2, big-endian byte-order mark FFFE), chunks
  `{fourcc, u32 size with the 12-byte header, u16 major, u16 minor}`, `_eof` (v1.1: u32
  length before it, u8 authentication type). Chunks are found by fourcc and major version.
- **Signatures.** `_eof` authentication (checked by `Function_822E1DC0` with the type each
  file requires): 0 none, 1 CRC32, 2 SHA-1, 3 SHA-1 + 256-byte RSA signature verified with
  the key in XEX resource "00" (`Crypto_VerifyRsaSignatureResource00` 0x8242EA68). Signed
  title files from Bungie verify unchanged; new ones would need that check relaxed.

Requests seen after sign-in (main menu, about two minutes):

| Request | What it is | Server answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /gameapi_omaha/UserUpdateRewards.ashx?getDailyChallenges=1&userId=&machineId=` | rewards sync: `rpul` v3 (Credits block, Armory flags, purchase log), `chpr` v2 (challenge progress), `loca` | `rpdl` v2 (chunk 0x227: the server's totals block + zero tail). Per-XUID record in `DATA_DIR/players/<xuid>.json`; Credits, counters and flags never go down (max / union), so the game's merge (`new = local + server - uploaded`) restores a reinstalled profile. No `dcha`: every client picks the same challenges from the date. Verified: rewards state 2 ("synced"), and raising the stored Credits to 20,000 made the game adopt them and show "New Armory items" |
| `POST /ReachPresenceApi/heartbeat.ashx` | `phbt` v5, 0x1BB bytes: in-matchmaking flag, u8 player count, 4 × 0x38 player entries (u64 XUID first), machine id at +0xE2, matchmaking party state from +0xF2 (party list of u64 XUID + u8 at +0xFF, stride 9) | `phbr` v2 (0x93 bytes, all zero). Its fields: +0 u8 flag, +1 u8 per-player flag mask, +2 u32 count, +6 u64 XUID[16] of players reserved for this party (counted by join checks), +0x86 u64, +0x8E u32 (`Function_8232F578`) |
| `POST /ReachPresenceApi/query.ashx` | `preq` v3: u32, u32 count, u64 XUID[16] of roster players with Bungie presence pending | `pplr` v5 (0x1094: u32 count + 16 records of 0x109 bytes, XUID at +8), sent with count 0. The roster copies a record to its entry +0x15C; the join check reads +0x44 (status), +0x49 max players, +0x4A players, +0x4C (`Function_822CAAC0`). The record layout beyond that is not mapped |
| `GET /storage/title/4d53085b/tracked/11860/default_hoppers/manifest_001.bin`, `en/rsa_manifest.bin`, `dynamic_pres_hopper_statistics.bin` | matchmaking playlists (11860 is the build) | 404 unless the operator provides the file under `DATA_DIR/storage/<path>` |
| `GET /storage/user/4d53085b/…/<xuid>/user.bin`, `recent_players.bin`, `/storage/machine/…/machine.bin` | per-player and per-machine files | 404 (a new player has none) |
| `GET /gameapi_omaha/ArenaGetSeasonStats.ashx`, `UserGetBnetSubscription.ashx`; `POST /upload_server/stats.ashx` | Arena, Bungie Pro, stats upload | 404 |

Active roster (for the session side): entries come from a provider per roster type
(`Function_8231A660`); each roster player's XAM presence comes from XPresenceSubscribe
(0x5801E) / XPresenceCreateEnumerator (0x58019) as XONLINE_PRESENCE (0xA4 bytes, session
id at +0xC; `Function_8231ACF8`). The session ids are then resolved to XSESSION_INFO (0x3C:
id, host XNADDR, key) by `Function_8226CAD8` (`Function_8231B3D0` / `8231B098`), the game
details (0x1270 bytes, as in the System Link reply) come from QoS, and the Bungie record
from `query.ashx`. Joining a roster player goes through the deferred join
`sub_822C6050` (`Function_822CB2D8`).

Not done: hopper files (matchmaking playlists, game and map variants, all signed), file
share (`FilesGetCatalog.ashx`, `FilesUpload.ashx`, … and user storage), Arena, the
Bungie presence record layout. (The `machineId` the game sends comes from
`XNetXnAddrToMachineId`; it is now 0xFA000000 plus the low half of the player's XUID, stable
across runs and server restarts, like `XNetLogonGetMachineID`.)

### 5.2 Xbox LIVE: friends, presence, sessions

With a server and `live_signin` (on by default), `src/kernel/xam_signin.cpp` reports user 0
signed in to Live (sign-in state 2, Live-enabled flag, all privileges, ONLINE XNADDR flag)
and `src/kernel/live_xmsg.cpp` answers the XAM messages behind Live, which the SDK fails or
stubs. Every player in our room on the server is a friend.

| Message | What the game does with it | Our answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XStringVerify (0xFC/0x5000C) | checks user text; retried every frame while it failed | every string OK |
| XFriendsCreateEnumerator (0xFC/0x58020) | the friends list (100 × 0xC4 X_ONLINE_FRIEND), read at sign-in and again on XN_FRIENDS_FRIEND_ADDED | the room's players with their presence |
| XPresenceSubscribe / Unsubscribe / CreateEnumerator (0xFC/0x5801E, 0x58044, 0x58019) | the roster's presence (X_ONLINE_PRESENCE, 0xA4: state, session id at +0xC); subscribe was retried every frame while it failed | presence from the roster |
| XSessionCreate / Delete / Modify / Join / Leave (0xFB/0xB0010-0xB0013, 0xB0018) | sessions for lobbies and parties | for a session we host: an online peer session id (0x80 type), our XNADDR and a random key in XSESSION_INFO; the newest joinable presence session is published with its slots. Leave (0xB0013) had no SDK handler |
| XSessionSearchByIds / ByID (0xFB/0xB0060, 0xB001B) | turns friends' session ids into XSESSION_INFO (host XNADDR, key) | the session each player published |
| XNetQosListen / XNetQosLookup | the host publishes its game description (the same bitstream as the System Link reply, 0x98 bytes); joiners probe it for "In Firefight Lobby 1/16" | the data travels with the host's presence; lookups are answered at once (XNQOS from `SystemHeapAlloc`, released by the SDK's XNetQosRelease) |
| XamUserAreUsersFriends, XNetLogonGetTitleID / MachineID | | from the roster; 0x4D53085B; 0xFA000000 + XUID |

Presence on the server: each client sends its friend state, the XSESSION_INFO of its joinable
session, a status line and opaque extras (slots and QoS data) in a `presence` message (type
13); `list` returns them for the room. When the roster changes the client posts
XN_FRIENDS_FRIEND_ADDED (0x04000002) and XN_FRIENDS_PRESENCE_CHANGED (0x04000001); Reach's
notification loop (`Function_826F7BD0`) then re-reads friends (`0x82320778`) and presence
(`0x8232E190`).

Roster internals (from Ghidra): the active roster's providers are at 0x82A43E08 (type 1:
friends, per local user at `*0x8315107C`, count at +0x7C; type 2: Xbox LIVE party at
`*0x83151040` + 0x1E18, 0x78-byte XPARTY_USER_INFO). The `XFriendsCreateEnumerator` task at
0x82A9666C (started by `Function_822688D8` on the Guide's gamercard notification 0x06010004)
is the Guide's "join from gamercard" path, not the roster.

### 5.3 File Share

Each player's File Share lives on the Reach Live server (`server/reach_live_files.py`,
files and an `index.json` per player under `DATA_DIR/fileshare/<XUID>/`; 24 slots and 100 MB
each). Verified with two instances: Lsp Tester uploaded a Forge map variant from Forge's
map browser (Local Files, X "File Options", "Upload to File Share": "Upload complete"); Kat
opened Lsp Tester's File Share from the Xbox LIVE roster (player menu, "File Share"), saw
the map with its name, description, author, date and size, and downloaded it ("Download
complete"); the package in Kat's local storage is byte-identical to the original save. The
listings and files are unsigned (`_eof` authentication 0), so no client-side relaxation
was needed.

Requests (`machineId`, `userId` and `shareId` are on every one; ids are hex):

| Request | Reply |
| --- | --- |
| `GET FilesGetCatalog.ashx?shareId&locale` (a player's share) | BLF `fitm` v4: 0x28-byte header (+0 u64 share, +8 owner gamertag char[16], +0x1C u32 quota in bytes, +0x20 u8 slot count, +0x22 u16 item count, +0x24 u8 length of a UTF-16 notice after the items), then items of 0x29C bytes. The UI reads the header in `sub_827CCE78`: slots free = slots − items, bytes used = Σ item size |
| `GET FilesGetCatalogInfo.ashx?shareIDs=a,b,…` | BLF `finf` v1: u16 count, u16, then a 0x24-byte record per share. The record does not feed the slot or space figures; its layout is not mapped (the server sends per-type counts) |
| `GET FilesNewUpload.ashx?uniqueId&fileType&uncompressedSize&compressedSize` | plain text: the server's id for the upload, hex (`strtoull(…, 16)`) |
| `POST FilesUpload.ashx` (multipart, part `upload` = the file; HTTP headers `machineid`, `userid`, `shareid`, `serverid` with quoted values, `startposition` on resume) | 200; the body is not read. The file is the game's BLF: `_blf`, `chdr` (uncompressed), `_cmp` (zlib, window bits 15), `_eof`, padded to whole 4 KB pages |
| `GET FilesGetUploadProgress.ashx?serverId` | bytes received, hex (resume) |
| `GET FilesGetDetails.ashx?serverId` | `fitm` v4 with one item and its extra data (u8 tag count at item +9, u32 extra size at item +0x298: none here) |
| `GET FilesStageForDownload.ashx?serverId&startPosition&fromAutoQueue&preview` | text lines `Size: n`, `FullSize: n` (both non-zero) and `InitialUrl: path` (`sub_8236D380`); the client then GETs `InitialUrl` from the same server (headers `machineId`, `serverId`, `userID`, `shareID`) and stores the bytes. `FilesResumeDownload.ashx` continues it |
| `GET FilesGetSearch.ashx` / `FilesGetSearchCount.ashx` (`fileType`, `gamertag` or `authortaghex`, `mapId`, `gameEngine`, `megaloCategoryIndex`, `fileAge`, `sortBy`, `taghex`, `page`) | `fitm` v4 (50 items a page) / `finf` v1. Implemented over every share (file type, author, map), not exercised in game yet |
| `GET FilesDelete.ashx?serverId` | 200 |

Item (0x298 bytes) = the file's content header with its first ids reordered: the content
header is the `chdr` payload after u16 build and u16 (0x2B0 bytes: +0 u8 file type, +4 u32
size, +8 u64 unique id, +0x10/+0x18/+0x20 parent, root and game ids, +0x28 activity, mode,
+0x2C i32 map id, +0x38 and +0x5C creator / modifier {u64 time, u64 XUID, char[16] name, u8
online}, +0x80 wchar name[128], +0x180 wchar description[128], …), and the item is
`header[8:0x10] + header[0:8] + header[0x28:]` (unique id first; parent, root and game ids
dropped). The server replaces the unique id with its own file id. File types seen: 2
screenshot, 3 film, 5 map variant, 6 game variant.

Runtime fix found on the way (`src/kernel/file_size_refresh.cpp`): the SDK caches each
host file's size and NtWriteFile does not refresh it, so after writing a download in 4 KB
pieces the game's attribute query saw 4096 of 8192 bytes, a chunk ran past the end and
the transfer failed. The override refreshes the size after writes that extend a file.

Not done: tags, recommendations, predefined queries (`fpre`) and megalo categories
(`fmca`), screenshot previews, the per-type counters next to a share (they stay 0), and
the service record (`UserGetServiceRecord.ashx` returns an empty `srid` v7 chunk of 0xD48
bytes, read straight into the game's buffer; not checked in game).
